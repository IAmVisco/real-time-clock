INFO:Xst:2261 - The FF/Latch <m1seg_0> in Unit <vga_driver> is equivalent to the following FF/Latch, which will be removed : <m1seg_3> 
INFO:Xst:2261 - The FF/Latch <s1seg_0> in Unit <vga_driver> is equivalent to the following FF/Latch, which will be removed : <s1seg_3> 
INFO:Xst:2261 - The FF/Latch <h1seg_0> in Unit <vga_driver> is equivalent to the following 2 FFs/Latches, which will be removed : <h1seg_3> <h1seg_4> 
WARNING:Xst:3002 - This design contains one or more registers/latches that are directly
   incompatible with the Spartan6 architecture. The two primary causes of this is
   either a register or latch described with both an asynchronous set and
   asynchronous reset, or a register or latch described with an asynchronous
   set or reset which however has an initialization value of the opposite 
   polarity (i.e. asynchronous reset with an initialization value of 1).
    While this circuit can be built, it creates a sub-optimal implementation
   in terms of area, power and performance. For a more optimal implementation
   Xilinx highly recommends one of the following:

          1) Remove either the set or reset from all registers and latches
             if not needed for required functionality
          2) Modify the code in order to produce a synchronous set
             and/or reset (both is preferred)
          3) Ensure all registers have the same initialization value as the
             described asynchronous set or reset polarity
          4) Use the -async_to_sync option to transform the asynchronous
             set/reset to synchronous operation
             (timing simulation highly recommended when using this option)

  Please refer to http://www.xilinx.com search string "Spartan6 asynchronous set/reset" for more details.
